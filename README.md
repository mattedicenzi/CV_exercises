## Descrption
The repository contains the laboratories of the Computer Vision course - Robotics Engineering and covers basic aspects of the computer vision.

Each folder is reserved to a given topic, as shown below:
1. Image filtering and Fourier transform
2. Edge detection and Hough transform
3. Color based segmentation and blob detection
4. NCC Based segmentation and Harris corner detection
5. Fundamental matrix estimation
6. Image matching and retrieval

Each folder contains a MATLAB script, some libraries used by the script and a short report describing the experiment and the results obtained.
To run the experiment, it is sufficient to open the script of the topic of interst (i.e 1 - Image filtering and Fourier transform).
